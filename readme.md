## Introduction

The objective of this and the following tutorials is to  build a web application consisting of a cloud based Database service/ API and a Web  Client.

The Supabase API will act as a web interface for the Database, allowing data access via HTTP and JavaScript.

The Client will act as the user interface to read, create, update, and delete data objects.
